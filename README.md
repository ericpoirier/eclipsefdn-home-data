This repo include experimental code that should not be used in a production environment.
We recommend that you update your database username/password & database name.

You will find in this repo, the required files to run a project website 
on www.eclipse.org. Without these files, your project website might not load. (This
is a problem that I am planing to fix).

These are not the settings files that we use on production, I am using this repo 
to test new features before we push them to production. 

For example, we will use this repo to test changes
for [Bug 421727](https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=421727) - Use mysqli extension instead.

My end goal is to reduce the number of required files needed to run an Eclipse Project websites. 
You can expect to see these changes in this repo before they are pushed to production.
